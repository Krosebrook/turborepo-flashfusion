# FlashFusion CI/CD Containerized Runners

This directory contains comprehensive CI/CD infrastructure for FlashFusion, implementing containerized runners and automated deployment pipelines.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Our CI/CD system provides:

- **Containerized GitHub Actions workflows** with optimized Docker images
- **Self-hosted runners** for sensitive operations
- **Multi-environment deployments** (staging, production, preview)
- **Comprehensive security scanning** and vulnerability management
- **Performance monitoring** and optimization
- **Blue-green deployments** for zero-downtime releases

## 📋 Workflows

### Core CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Triggers:** Push to main/develop, Pull requests, Manual dispatch

**Features:**
- 🎯 **Smart change detection** - Only runs jobs for modified packages

- 🐳 **Containerized execution** - All jobs run in consistent Node.js Alpine containers
- 📦 **Turborepo optimization** - Leverages caching and dependency graph
- 🚀 **Multi-environment deployment** - Automated staging/production releases

**Jobs:**
1. **detect-changes** - Uses `dorny/paths-filter` to identify modified packages
2. **lint-and-typecheck** - ESLint and TypeScript validation
3. **test** - Matrix testing across all packages
4. **build** - Turborepo build with artifact caching
5. **security-scan** - npm audit and CodeQL analysis
6. **performance-test** - Load testing and benchmarks
7. **deploy-staging** - Automated staging deployment
8. **deploy-production** - Production deployment with approvals

- Optimized layer caching
- Health checks included

**App-Specific Dockerfiles:**
- `apps/web/Dockerfile` - Next.js optimized build
- `apps/api/Dockerfile` - Node.js API server

**Docker Compose:**
- `docker-compose.yml` - Production environment
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development with hot reload

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

- **Grafana** - Visualization dashboards
- **Custom metrics** - Application-specific monitoring

### Health Checks
- **Container health** - Docker health check directives
- **Application health** - `/health` endpoints
- **Infrastructure health** - Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes

## 🔒 Security Features

### Vulnerability Management
- **Automated scanning** - Daily security scans
- **SARIF integration** - GitHub Security tab integration
- **Compliance reporting** - License and security compliance

### Secret Management
- **GitHub Secrets** - Encrypted environment variables
