# Repository Guidelines & Development Standards

## üéØ Project Structure & Module Organization

- `apps/web/`: Next.js 14 dashboard; page routes live under `pages/` and shared React features under `src/` with Tailwind styles in `styles/`.
- `apps/api/`: Express-based orchestration service; `main.js` bootstraps middleware while agent endpoints and webhooks sit in dedicated folders (`webhooks/`, `auth/`).
- `packages/ai-agents/`: Core agent logic split into `core/`, `orchestration/`, and `workflows/`; import from here instead of duplicating agent code in apps.
- `packages/shared/`: Cross-cutting types and helpers (`types/`, `utils/`); prefer adding new shared contracts here so both web and API stay in sync.
- `tools/cli/`: FlashFusion CLI (`ff-cli.js`) drives migrations and validation; extend this when adding automation tasks.

### Agent Quick-Start Checklist
- `npm ci` to install workspace dependencies (respect lockfile).
- `npm run restore-state` to reload cached Turborepo context and commit guardrails.
- `npm run ff -- validate quick` to confirm repo health before making changes.
- Create or update `.env.local` variants from `.env.example` in touched workspaces.
- Start the focused target (`npx turbo run dev --filter <package>`) and review the package README for domain nuances.
- Capture notes in `docs/session-notes/` (or your working scratchpad) so the next agent inherits context.

## üöÄ Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm run dev`: Runs `turbo dev` to start all watch-mode targets; narrow scope with `npx turbo run dev --filter @flashfusion/web` (or `@flashfusion/api`) when iterating.
- `npm run build`: Executes `turbo build` across workspaces, respecting dependency graph outputs.
- `npm run lint` / `npm run format`: Aggregated ESLint and Prettier passes; add package-level scripts so these commands stay green.
- `npm run type-check`: Ensures TypeScript projects emit no type errors before merging.
- `npm run test`: Reserved for Turborepo-wide test execution; place coverage reports under `coverage/` to benefit from caching.
- `npm run ff -- <subcommand>`: Access CLI utilities (e.g., `npm run ff -- validate quick`, `npm run ff -- migrate all`).
- `npm run commit-check`: Check staged commit size before committing (enforces 500-line limit).

## üîí Commit Size Enforcement & Quality Standards

This repository enforces atomic commits to maintain high code quality and reviewability:

### Automatic Enforcement
Every commit is automatically checked for:
- **Size limits**: Hard 500-line limit, 200-line warning
- **File count**: Warning at 10+ files changed
- **Message format**: Conventional commits required (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)

### Commit Workflow Tools
```bash
# Check before committing
npm run commit-check                  # Manual size check
git commit-size                       # Git alias for staged changes
git atomic-add file1.js file2.js     # Stage files and show impact

# Splitting large commits
git unstage-all                       # Clear staging area
git split-commit                      # Undo last commit
git rebase -i HEAD~3                  # Interactive split (own branches only)

# Emergency bypass (use sparingly)
HUSKY=0 git commit -m "large migration - will split in follow-ups"
```

If you invoke the bypass, document the split plan in the commit body or PR description and land the follow-up commits before requesting review so reviewers are never left with an oversized changeset.

### Best Practices for Atomic Commits
- **One logical change per commit**: If you use "and" in the subject, split it
- **Group related files**: Tests with source, UI components together
- **Dependencies first**: Config changes before code that uses them
- **Documentation with implementation**: Update docs in same commit as feature
- **Breaking changes**: Call out clearly in commit message and body

## üé® Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Format with Prettier defaults (2-space indentation, single quotes) via `npm run format`; never hand-roll whitespace.
- Follow ESLint recommendations; extend `.eslintrc` locally when introducing new syntax and keep warnings at zero.
- React components and TypeScript types use `PascalCase`; hooks and utilities stay `camelCase`; Next.js page files remain `kebab-case`.
- Tailwind classes group by layout ‚Üí spacing ‚Üí color to aid diff reviews.

## ‚úÖ Testing Guidelines

- Co-locate unit specs as `*.test.ts` (or `.tsx/.js`) beside the code or in `__tests__/`; lint ignores test-only globals.
- Use Jest + React Testing Library in `apps/web`, and Jest + Supertest for `apps/api`; share fixtures from `packages/shared` when possible.
- Target ‚â•80% line coverage (per knowledge-base guidance); store local artifacts under `coverage/<workspace>/` so CI can surface them, and only commit the HTML reports when pipeline reviewers request evidence.
- Document any new test scripts inside the package `README` or `package.json` so `turbo test` can discover them.

## üìù Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

### Commit Message Format
```bash
# Required format: type(scope): description
feat(auth): add JWT token validation
fix(api): handle null user in profile endpoint
docs: update API documentation for v2 endpoints
refactor(ui): extract common button components

# Avoid these formats
# ‚ùå "fix stuff and add feature"
# ‚ùå "WIP"
# ‚ùå "Fixed bug"
```

### Commit Size Guidelines
- **‚úÖ Ideal**: < 200 lines changed
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable**: 200-500 lines changed (warning shown)
- **‚ùå Blocked**: 500+ lines changed (commit rejected)

### Pull Request Standards
- Include focused commits per concern (UI, API, tooling) so partial reverts stay safe in a monorepo.
- Pull requests must outline scope, linked issues, local test commands, and‚Äîfor UI tweaks‚Äîbefore/after screenshots or Loom links.
- Request reviews from owners of affected workspaces and call out breaking changes in the PR description and `changeset` if applicable.
- **Each PR should pass all size checks**: No commits over 500 lines unless explicitly justified

## üîê Security & Configuration Tips

- Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env.local`; never commit secrets. Required vars include `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, and datastore URLs referenced in `turbo.json` `globalEnv`.
- Keep environment overrides per workspace (e.g., `apps/web/.env.local`, `apps/api/.env.local`) and record any new keys back in the relevant `.env.example` file.
- Run the workspace health check (`npm run ff -- validate quick`) before builds to surface missing env vars, and note in PRs how new secrets are provisioned in staging/production.
- When adding new integrations, guard API routes with middleware in `apps/api/auth/` and document required scopes in `docs/`.
- CLI additions should respect the session restoration flow (`npm run restore-state`) so other agents recover context reliably.

## üß≠ Package Workflow Playbooks

### packages/ai-agents
- **Needed**: Run `npm run type-check -- --filter @flashfusion/ai-agents` and `npm run test -- --filter @flashfusion/ai-agents`; update `packages/ai-agents/README.md` when workflows change.
- **Modern best practices**: Model new flows in `workflows/` with strongly typed contracts from `packages/shared`, add contract fixtures under `__tests__/fixtures`, and wire integration probes via `tools/cli` subcommands so automations stay reproducible.

### packages/shared
- **Needed**: Maintain backwards-compatible exports in `packages/shared/src/index.ts` and run downstream smoke tests (`npx turbo run lint --filter ...web ...api`) after updates.
- **Modern best practices**: Gate new helpers behind generics or schema validators, publish migration notes in `docs/changelogs/shared.md`, and add usage examples in consuming package READMEs to prevent drift.

### apps/web
- **Needed**: Keep feature toggles in `apps/web/src/config/flags.ts` and validate routes with `npm run lint -- --filter @flashfusion/web` before shipping.
- **Modern best practices**: Capture component stories (Storybook or MDX) alongside features, snapshot key pages with Playwright smoke scripts, and use the design tokens from `packages/shared` rather than inlining Tailwind compositions.

### apps/api
- **Needed**: Register new endpoints under `apps/api/routes/` with matching Supertest coverage and ensure middleware ordering stays consistent in `main.js`.
- **Modern best practices**: Enforce input contracts through Zod validators, queue side-effects via orchestration workflows instead of inline logic, and document webhook signature expectations in `docs/integrations/` whenever they change.

## üîß Development Workflow Integration

### With Existing Tools
This commit enforcement integrates seamlessly with:
- **Turborepo**: Size limits apply per commit, not per package
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Formatting runs in pre-commit hooks
- **CI/CD**: Clean commits ensure smooth deployments
- **Code Review**: Smaller commits = faster, better reviews

### Session Management Compatibility
The enforcement system works with the existing session restoration:
- `npm run restore-state`: Includes commit size in environment analysis
- `.turborepo-state.json`: Tracks commit enforcement status
- Session context includes recent commit patterns and sizes

### Emergency Procedures
If you absolutely must commit large changes:
1. Use `HUSKY=0 git commit -m "feat: large migration - splitting in follow-ups"`
2. **Immediately** create follow-up commits to break down the change:
   ```bash
   git add specific-files-group-1
   git commit -m "refactor: extract user service from migration"
   git add specific-files-group-2
   git commit -m "refactor: separate UI components from migration"
   ```

## üìä Quality Metrics & Monitoring

### Tracking Commit Health
```bash
# Check your recent commit sizes
git log --oneline --stat | head -10

# Find largest commits in history
git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" --stat | grep "files changed"

# Repository-wide size analysis
npm run ff -- validate commits  # Future CLI command
```

### Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ Average commit size < 100 lines
- ‚úÖ <5% of commits need warnings
- ‚úÖ Zero commits blocked by size limits
- ‚úÖ Faster code review turnaround
- ‚úÖ Easier debugging with focused commits

**üéØ Remember**: These guidelines exist to maintain code quality, enable better reviews, and make the repository easier to navigate and debug. When in doubt, split it out!
