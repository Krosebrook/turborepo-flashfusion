# Architectural Decision Records

## 2025-09-18: Repository Cleanup and Organization

### Context
The git repository was initialized at the Windows user home directory level, causing the entire filesystem to be tracked in version control. This created management, performance, and security issues.

### Decision
1. Added comprehensive `.gitignore` file to exclude development tools and temporary files
2. Created documentation structure in `/docs` folder
3. Established checkpoint tagging system for state preservation

### Alternatives Considered
- **Option A**: Move entire repository to subdirectory (recommended for future)
- **Option B**: Continue with home directory as repo root (current state)
- **Option C**: Create new repository and migrate files

### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Reduced tracked files from 35,000+ to manageable number
  - Improved git performance
  - Better security (sensitive files excluded)
- **Negative**:
  - Still have structural issue with repo location
  - Requires future migration to proper directory

### Status
Implemented (temporary solution)

## 2025-09-18: Documentation Standards

### Context
Project lacked proper documentation for handover and continuity. New developers would struggle to understand current state and next steps.

### Decision
Implement comprehensive documentation structure:
- `PROGRESS.md` - Track completed work and current state
- `PROJECT.md` - Describe repository structure and setup
- `DECISIONS.md` - Record architectural decisions (this file)
- `TODO.md` - List pending tasks and priorities
- `FOUND.md` - Research findings and discoveries

### Alternatives Considered
- Single README file (insufficient detail)
- Wiki-based documentation (requires external tool)
- No documentation (poor practice)

### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Clear handover process
  - Traceable decision history
  - Reduced onboarding time
- **Negative**:
  - Requires maintenance
  - Additional files to manage

### Status
Implemented

## 2025-09-18: Git Workflow Configuration

### Context
Repository uses non-standard branch naming (`cicd-clean` current, `master` as main) and has direct commit access without protection rules.

### Decision
- Maintain current branch structure for now
- Document branch purposes
- Use conventional commits for clear history
- Tag checkpoints for important states

### Alternatives Considered
- Switch to `main` branch standard
- Implement branch protection rules
- Require pull requests for all changes

### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Preserves existing work
  - Allows rapid development
  - Clear commit messages
- **Negative**:
  - Non-standard branch naming
  - No enforced code review
  - Risk of breaking changes

### Status
Accepted (temporary)

## Future Decisions Needed

### Repository Restructuring
- **Question**: Should we move the repository to a dedicated project folder?
- **Options**:
  1. Fresh clone in new location
  2. Move existing files
  3. Filter branch to remove history
- **Recommendation**: Fresh clone in `C:\Users\kyler\projects\turborepo-flashfusion`

### Monorepo Architecture
- **Question**: How should the TurboRepo structure be organized?
- **Considerations**:
  - Package organization
  - Shared dependencies
  - Build pipeline configuration
  - Deployment strategy

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Question**: What CI/CD tools and workflows should be implemented?
- **Branch Name Hint**: `cicd-clean` suggests CI/CD work in progress
- **Needs**:
  - GitHub Actions configuration
  - Test automation
  - Deployment automation
  - Environment management

### Security Configuration
- **Question**: How to handle secrets and sensitive data?
- **Current Issues**:
  - Entire home directory in git
  - Potential exposure of credentials
  - No secret scanning
- **Recommendations**:
  - Implement secret scanning
  - Use environment variables
  - Add pre-commit hooks
