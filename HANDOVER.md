# Project Handover Summary

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST

**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Repository**: https://github.com/Krosebrook/turborepo-flashfusion.git
**Current Branch**: `cicd-clean`

### üö® Major Issue Discovered

The git repository is incorrectly initialized at the Windows user home directory (`C:\Users\kyler`), causing:
- 35,000+ files being tracked (entire filesystem)
- Severe performance issues
- Security risks (potential credential exposure)
- Unmanageable repository state

### ‚úÖ What Was Done

1. **Added .gitignore file** to exclude development tools and temporary files
2. **Created comprehensive documentation** in `/docs` folder:
   - `PROGRESS.md` - Current state and completed work
   - `PROJECT.md` - Repository structure and setup instructions
   - `DECISIONS.md` - Architectural decisions and rationale
   - `TODO.md` - Prioritized task list
   - `FOUND.md` - Research findings and discoveries

3. **Created git checkpoint tag** for state preservation

### üî• Immediate Actions Required

1. **DO NOT CONTINUE WORKING IN HOME DIRECTORY**
2. **Create proper project structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p C:\Users\kyler\projects
   cd C:\Users\kyler\projects
   git clone https://github.com/Krosebrook/turborepo-flashfusion.git
   cd turborepo-flashfusion
   ```

3. **Copy only project files** from current location
4. **Security audit** for any exposed credentials

### üìã Key Findings

- Repository appears to be a TurboRepo monorepo project
- Multiple language ecosystems present (JavaScript, Go, Python)
- CI/CD work in progress (branch name: `cicd-clean`)
- Git LFS issues with some binary files
- No visible application code in root directory (likely due to structure issue)

### üéØ Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **P0 - Fix Repository Structure** (CRITICAL)
2. **P0 - Security Audit** (check for exposed credentials)
3. **P1 - Clean up current repository**
4. **P1 - Set up CI/CD pipeline**
5. **P2 - Documentation improvements**

### üìö Documentation Location

All detailed documentation is in the `/docs` folder:
- Start with `TODO.md` for task priorities
- Read `PROJECT.md` for repository context
- Check `DECISIONS.md` for architectural choices
- Review `FOUND.md` for research insights
- Track progress in `PROGRESS.md`

### üîß Environment Details

- **OS**: Windows 10/11 (MinGW Git Bash)
- **Languages**: Node.js, Go, Python installed
- **Tools**: Chocolatey, Docker, Various CLIs
- **IDE**: VS Code with extensions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

1. Git commits may hang due to repository size
2. Git LFS errors in go/pkg/mod
3. Permission denied errors in some Windows folders
4. Line editing warnings in .bashrc

### üí° Recommendations

1. **Start fresh**: Clone to dedicated project folder
2. **Use .gitignore**: Already created, needs to be effective in new location
3. **Small commits**: Due to repository issues, keep changes minimal
4. **Document everything**: Continue updating /docs folder

### üÜò If You Get Stuck

1. Check `/docs` folder for all documentation
2. Review git history: `git log --oneline`
3. Check current state: `git status`
4. Look for checkpoint: `git tag -l`

---

**Important**: This repository needs immediate restructuring before any development work can continue effectively. The current state is a result of git being initialized in the wrong directory. Please prioritize fixing this structural issue.

Good luck! üöÄ
