# Research Findings & Discoveries

## Repository Analysis (2025-09-18)

### Found: Git Repository at Home Directory
- **Pattern**: Entire Windows user directory configured as git repository
- **Location**: `C:\Users\kyler\.git`
- **Usage**: Tracking 35,000+ files including system and personal files
- **Impact**: Performance degradation, security risks, difficult management

### Decision
Must restructure repository to dedicated project directory. This is a critical architectural issue that affects all development work.

---

### Found: TurboRepo Monorepo Structure
- **Pattern**: Repository name suggests TurboRepo implementation
- **Location**: Repository named `turborepo-flashfusion`
- **Usage**: Modern monorepo management for JavaScript/TypeScript projects
- **Expected Structure**:
  ```
  /apps        - Application packages
  /packages    - Shared packages
  /turbo.json  - TurboRepo configuration
  ```

### Decision
Verify TurboRepo setup once repository is properly relocated. May need initialization if not yet configured.

---

### Found: Multiple Development Ecosystems
- **Pattern**: Various language ecosystems detected
- **Locations**:
  - `/go/` - Go modules and packages
  - Node.js indicators (npm, package.json expected)
  - Python indicators (pip references)
- **Usage**: Polyglot development environment

### Decision
Maintain comprehensive .gitignore covering all ecosystems. Consider separate repositories for different language projects.

---

### Found: Git LFS Configuration
- **Pattern**: Git Large File Storage errors
- **Location**: `go/pkg/mod/github.com/charmbracelet/glamour@v0.10.0/`
- **Error**: "Smudge error: Object does not exist on the server"
- **Impact**: Binary files may not sync properly

### Decision
Need to run `git lfs install` and `git lfs pull` to fix. May need to reconfigure LFS tracking rules.

---

### Found: Development Tools Installation
- **Pattern**: Multiple package managers and tools
- **Locations**:
  - `.chocolatey/` - Windows package manager
  - `.encore/` - Encore framework
  - `.console-ninja/` - Console debugging tool
  - `.azure/` - Azure tools
- **Usage**: Comprehensive development environment

### Decision
These should be user-specific and not tracked in project repository. Added to .gitignore.

---

### Found: CI/CD Branch Naming
- **Pattern**: Branch named `cicd-clean`
- **Location**: Current working branch
- **Usage**: Suggests CI/CD pipeline work in progress
- **Context**: Branched from `master` (not `main`)

### Decision
Continue work on CI/CD setup after fixing repository structure. Document pipeline requirements.

---

## Environment Discoveries

### Found: Windows MinGW Environment
- **Pattern**: Git Bash on Windows
- **Location**: Platform identifier `MINGW64_NT-10.0-26100`
- **Usage**: Unix-like commands on Windows
- **Note**: Line editing warnings in `.bashrc`

### Decision
Ensure all scripts and commands are Windows-compatible. Consider PowerShell alternatives for Windows-specific tasks.

---

### Found: Missing Core Project Files
- **Pattern**: No visible application code in root
- **Location**: Expected but not found in home directory
- **Missing**:
  - `package.json`
  - `turbo.json`
  - `/apps` directory
  - `/packages` directory
  - `README.md`

### Decision
These files likely exist but are either:
1. In a subdirectory not yet identified
2. Not yet created (empty repository)
3. In a different branch

Need to locate actual project files after repository restructuring.

---

## Security Findings

### Found: Potential Credential Exposure Risk
- **Pattern**: Home directory under version control
- **Locations at risk**:
  - `.env` files
  - `.aws/` credentials
  - `.ssh/` keys
  - Browser profiles with saved passwords
  - Application configuration files

### Decision
Critical security audit needed. Must ensure no credentials in git history. Consider using BFG Repo Cleaner if sensitive data found.

---

## Performance Observations

### Found: Slow Git Operations
- **Pattern**: Git commands taking excessive time
- **Location**: Due to 35,000+ tracked files
- **Impact**: Development velocity severely impacted

### Decision
Repository restructuring is not optionalâ€”it's blocking efficient development.

## Next Investigation Areas

1. **Locate Actual Project Code**:
   - Search for package.json
   - Find turbo.json configuration
   - Identify application entry points

2. **Understand Project Architecture**:
   - Determine if truly using TurboRepo
   - Map out package dependencies
   - Identify deployment targets

3. **Review Git History**:
   - Check for sensitive data exposure
   - Understand development patterns
   - Identify key contributors

4. **Analyze Build System**:
   - Find build scripts
   - Understand deployment process
   - Check for existing CI/CD
