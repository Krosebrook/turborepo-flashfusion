# Repository Categorization and Organization Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategic categorization and organization of FlashFusion repositories, defining which projects belong in standalone repositories versus the main turborepo monorepo.

## Categorization Framework

### 🎯 Decision Matrix

| Factor | Standalone Repository | Turborepo Monorepo |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Team Ownership** | Single team ownership | Shared/multiple teams |
| **Release Cycle** | Independent releases | Coordinated releases |
| **Dependencies** | Minimal shared deps | Heavy shared dependencies |
| **Complexity** | High complexity/specialized | Moderate complexity |
| **Technology Stack** | Different tech stack | Aligned tech stack |
| **Security Requirements** | Isolated security needs | Standard security |
| **Deployment** | Independent deployment | Coordinated deployment |

## Repository Categories

### 🏢 Standalone Application Repositories

#### Criteria for Standalone
- **Independent Business Domain**: Complete business functionality
- **Autonomous Team**: Dedicated development team
- **Independent Deployment**: Separate deployment lifecycle
- **Different Technology Stack**: Non-JavaScript/TypeScript stack
